    <h3>The origins</h3>
    <p>The band was formed back in 2008,\n Lead gitarist John Blue and his best friend bass player John Shure where rehersing on their own and had some hard rock tunes but they couldn't find a singer.\<nav>
      That's when lead vocal Colis Fragile came to light, they heard him while he was in another band callled Haze. They wanted him badly and in the end after hearing the material he couldn't resist.\<nav>
        Colis then pulled the Haze drummer Mark Calzonne and the bend was formed.</p>
